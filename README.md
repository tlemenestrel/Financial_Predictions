# LSTM-GARCH

## Introduction

Volatility plays an important role in financial markets for pricing derivatives, portfolio risk management and hedging strategies. Therefore, being able to correctly predict volatility of stock markets is crucial. This repository contains a Python implementation of a Hybrid LSTM-GARCH model for forecasting volatility. It is based on the following [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417418301416). The GARCH models are built using PyFlux while the LSTMs are built with TensorFlow and Keras.

**Genome Processing** is a Python software to generate _DNA references_ and compute the alignments of given DNA sequences with the _generated reference_. 

The code generates an **output file** that contains the index of the _matches of each sequence with the reference_ and the _percentage of how many matches
each sequence has_ (i.e. if a sequence matche once, twice or does not match the reference) and the _computing time_.
